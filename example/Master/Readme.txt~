Description
-------------
The master describes a controller for a system that reads a value from a sensor. 
If 5 values are accumulated, they are averaged and send to a lcd-screen.
The FSM of the master has two states(collecting and printing). 
He stays in collecting until 5 values are collected. 
Then the state changes and he stays within printing until the lcd is ready to read the values.
Afterwards the master returns the the state collecting.

From the Master.h description the master.model is created. 
I'd recommend to compare those two files and get an understanding 
for the abstraction from a SystemC description to a architecture level description. 
From master.model the complete set of properties in master_property.vhi is created. 
Here I'd recommend to check which part of the system model is covered by which property.

In order to prove completeness the .gfv is needed.
