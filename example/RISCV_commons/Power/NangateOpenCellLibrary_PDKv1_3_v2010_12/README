Nangate 45nm Open Cell Library
------------------------------

The Nangate Open Cell Library is an open-source, standard-cell library provided for the purposes of testing and exploring EDA flows.

Nangate has developed and donated this library to Si2.org for open use. The library is intended to aid university research programs
and organizations such as Si2 in developing flows, developing circuits and exercising new algorithms. In its first release the 
Open Cell Library contains 38 different functions ranging from buffers to scan flip-flops with set and reset. All the different 
cell functions come in multiple drive strength variants end up with more than 100 different cells in the library. 

The library was generated using Nangate's Library Creatorâ„¢ and the 45nm FreePDK Base Kit from North Carolina State University (NCSU) 
and characterization was done using the Predictive Technology Model (PTM) from Arizona State University (ASU). 

The library will be enhanced over time based on user suggestions and requests. If you have suggestions for development of 
the library then please fill out the request form you can find at www.opencelllibrary.org with your suggestions.

The Open Cell Library contains the following views:

    * Liberty (.lib) with NLDM/NLPM, CCS Timing and ECSM Timing data
    * LEF View
    * Verilog(R)
    * VITAL (VHDL Initiative Towards ASIC Libraries)
    * Spice netlists (pre and post extraction)
    * GDSII
    * Schematics
    * Library databook in HTML/XML format
    * OpenAccess library databases with layouts and netlists
